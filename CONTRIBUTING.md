# Contributing to bray-platform

Thanks for your interest in contributing. A few things to know before you open a PR.

## Licensing and the CLA

Every package in this repo is licensed AGPL-3.0-only. The maintainer also ships commercial
licenses and proprietary extensions built on top of this same code — that dual model is what
funds ongoing development of the open-source platform.

For the maintainer to be able to include your contribution in both the open-source packages
*and* those commercial/proprietary offerings, we need a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
on file. The CLA does not take away your rights to your own contribution — it grants the
maintainer the additional rights needed to relicense it alongside the rest of the codebase.

You'll be prompted to sign the CLA automatically the first time you open a pull request, via
a bot comment. Signing is a one-time action per contributor (tracked in this repo, no external
service).

## Development

- Node >= 20, npm >= 10. This repo uses npm workspaces + Turborepo; do not introduce another
  package manager.
- `npm install` at the repo root installs and links all packages.
- `npm run build` builds every package (via `turbo run build`, in dependency order).
- `npm run typecheck` typechecks every package.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` runs the SPDX license-header check (and future lint
  rules) across every package's `src/`.
- Every source file under `packages/*/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` must carry the SPDX header enforced
  by `@heybray/dev-config`'s eslint config. Run `npm run lint:fix` to add it automatically to
  new files.

## Pull requests

- One logical change per PR where reasonable.
- Add a [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) (`npx changeset add`) for any
  change that should trigger a version bump on publish.
- Make sure `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run lint` all pass before requesting
  review.
- Run `./bin/check-scenarios-vocabulary.sh` — the case-insensitive Scenarios vocabulary gate
  must pass (also enforced in CI).

## Scenarios vocabulary gate

Platform packages must not introduce new Scenarios-era **wire** vocabulary (`scenario`,
`roleplay`, and camelCase variants such as `detachedFromScenarios`). The gate is
case-insensitive:

```bash
./bin/check-scenarios-vocabulary.sh
```

Implementation: `grep -rni 'scenario\|roleplay' packages/*/src` with an allowlist. A match is
**allowed** only when:

1. **Deprecated alias** — the line contains `DEPRECATED` (deprecated response fields, path
   helpers, style keys, and type aliases kept until 2.0.0).
2. **`legacy*` identifiers** — in `star-map-paths.ts` or `TeamStarMapComponents.tsx` only
   (e.g. `legacyMemberScenarioHistoryPath`).
3. **Doc-comments** — JSDoc/block-comment lines (`*`, `/**`) mentioning Scenarios as product
   context, not as API surface.

Any other match fails the gate. Neutral replacements (`content-history`, `detachedCount`,
`ContentListRowComponent`, etc.) are required for new code.

These gates (and the package-boundary checks in `bin/guards.sh`) run automatically in CI
via the org **`guards`** job — not only when contributors remember to run the script
manually.

## Publishing to npm

CI publishes via `.github/workflows/release.yml` when a "Version Packages" PR merges to `main`.
The workflow needs a repo secret **`NPM_TOKEN`**: an npm **Automation** token (not Publish) for the
`brayg` account with write access to the `@heybray` scope. If the token is missing or invalid,
`npm publish` fails with a misleading **`E404 Not Found`** on scoped packages — that is an auth
failure, not a missing package.

To publish manually (same as CI):

```bash
npm ci
npx turbo run build
npx changeset publish
```

Requires `npm whoami` to return `brayg` (or another maintainer on the `@heybray` packages).

## Cross-repo development workflow

How changes flow between the app repos (`bray-scenarios`, `bray-flashcards`, `bray-premium`)
and `bray-platform`. Canonical copy also lives in `bray-scenarios/docs/dev-workflow.md`.
### Standing rules (default behavior — not restated per task)

These apply to every session working across these repos, not just when a specific brief
says so:

- **Default to the yalc loop for any cross-repo work.** Don't hand-edit or test across a
  repo boundary without it — see "Automated" below for the one-liners.
- **Never merge a Version Packages PR, or otherwise trigger an actual npm publish,
  without stopping and asking the owner first** — even when all checks are green and
  auto-merge would otherwise apply. This is the one PR in the whole workflow that always
  gets an explicit human go-ahead; ordinary consumer/config PRs still auto-merge as
  designed. Confirm auto-merge is not armed automatically on `changeset-release/main`
  PRs specifically — if the changesets action or any workflow step ever enables it
  there, disable it; this is a mechanical check, not just a documented intention.
- **Don't burn a CI round-trip per tiny edit.** Iterate locally — commit locally,
  don't push — until a change is complete and locally yalc-verified; push once. Every
  push to an open PR branch re-triggers `guards`+`verify`, so five WIP pushes cost five
  full CI runs for no reason.
- **Batch related small fixes into one PR** rather than opening a new PR per one-line
  change — same principle as the batched-platform-work policy below, generalized to any
  small related work, not just changeset batches.
- **Don't idle-block waiting on a CI run** if there's independent work to do — open the
  PR, arm auto-merge (except the publish PR, per above), move on, and check back when
  the next step actually depends on that PR being merged.
- **Never bypass `guards`/`verify` "because the change is small."** Both real incidents
  in this project (yalc-polluted manifests reaching `main`; unpublished-API imports
  reaching `main`) happened on changes that felt small enough to skip the gate. The fix
  for CI being slow is making the gate cheaper and less frequent — caching
  (`actions/cache` keyed on the lockfile hash, or a Turborepo remote cache in
  `bray-platform`) and a docs-only fast path *inside* the job (detect "only `.md` files
  changed" and exit quickly — never via `paths-ignore`, which stops the check from
  reporting at all and leaves a required-check PR stuck on "Expected" forever) — never
  making the gate optional.

### Automated (preferred day-to-day)

From `bray-platform` after editing platform packages:

```bash
./bin/yalc-sync.sh server-kit          # rebuild server-kit + workspace dependents, publish+push
./bin/yalc-sync.sh --link premium      # once per machine (or use a path); needs .yalc-targets.local
./bin/yalc-sync.sh --status premium
./bin/yalc-sync.sh --unlink premium    # before commit — guards reject yalc in manifests
```

Feature-package repos use the same flag shape, and both may need linking into premium
at once (e.g. a `server-kit` change that `scenarios-server` also depends on):

```bash
# bray-scenarios
./bin/yalc-sync.sh scenarios-server
./bin/yalc-sync.sh --link premium

# bray-flashcards
./bin/yalc-sync.sh flashcards-server
./bin/yalc-sync.sh --link premium
```

Copy `.yalc-targets.local.example` → `.yalc-targets.local` (gitignored) so shortcuts like
`premium` resolve to your sibling-repo paths. The manual steps below are unchanged — these
scripts sequence the same operations.

### The invariant

**A consumer repo's `main` only ever points at published `@heybray/*` versions.**
Local bridges (yalc) are a workbench state, never a committed state. Fresh-clone CI is
the enforcement: it can only resolve what npm can resolve.

### The two loops

**Inner loop (minutes, local only)** — while platform or feature-package code is in flux:

```bash
# in bray-platform, after editing a package:
npm run build --workspace=@heybray/<pkg>     # if the package has a build
yalc publish packages/<pkg>                  # or: yalc push (updates all linked consumers)

# in the consumer repo (once per machine/branch):
yalc add @heybray/<pkg> && npm install
# iterate: edit → build → yalc push → consumer picks up the copy in place
```

Each consumer app's `bin/dev.sh` runs `bin/yalc-cache-bust.sh` automatically so Vite's
`optimizeDeps` cache invalidates when yalc swaps `@heybray/*` content under an unchanged
version string — without that, "picks up the copy in place" was not reliably true after
a restart.

**Yalc doesn't understand transitive dependencies** — if a change to `server-kit`
matters to `gamification`, and `gamification` is what `scenarios-server` depends on, the
consumer needs `server-kit` **and** `gamification` **and** `scenarios-server` all
yalc-linked together, not just the outermost one. This is the failure mode traced during
the Phase 6A premium walkthrough.

**Outer loop (when the change is right)**:

1. PR into `bray-platform` (or the relevant feature-package repo) — **every change
   carries its own changeset** in the same PR.
2. Merge → changesets opens/updates the "Version Packages" PR → merging that publishes
   to npm via CI (provenance attested). No manual publishes.
3. Consumer branch: `yalc remove @heybray/<pkg> && npm install` for every linked
   package, bump the pins to the published versions, land the consumer PR.

Why yalc and not the alternatives:

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **yalc** | ✅ Copies built output the way npm would — same layout, no symlinks. |
| `npm link` | ❌ Symlinks can load two instances of one package; `server-kit` holds module-level singletons (db handle, seam registries) that silently split. React duplicates the same way. |
| `file:../bray-platform/...` / sibling `tsconfig` paths | ❌ Rewrites package.json/lockfile with paths that must never merge, or (the tsconfig-paths form) silently bypasses yalc/npm resolution entirely under `tsx` — this exact bug broke `reconcileGamificationProjection` during the Phase 6A walkthrough. |
| Deep imports (`node_modules/@heybray/*/src/...`) | ❌ Bypasses the exports contract entirely. Already bitten once (6A Step 4). |
| Copying into `node_modules` | ❌ Obviously. Also already attempted once. |

### Guard rails (mechanical, not aspirational)

- `.yalc/` and `yalc.lock` are gitignored in every consumer repo — **but note `yalc add`
  also rewrites `package.json`** with a `file:.yalc/...` dependency, and package.json is
  tracked. Therefore every consumer's CI (and its local test script) greps `package.json`
  + lockfile for the string `.yalc` and **fails on any hit**.
- **No sibling-repo `tsconfig.json` path aliases for `@heybray/*` feature packages** —
  resolution must go through `node_modules` (npm pin or yalc copy) exactly like the
  platform packages already do. A sibling-path alias silently bypasses yalc under `tsx`
  and creates a duplicate `server-kit` module instance (see the alternatives table
  above).
- After `yalc remove`, always `npm install` to restore the lockfile before committing —
  `yalc remove` alone leaves lockfile entries and broken symlinks behind (proven in the
  6A navbar incident: a Docker build failed on lockfile `.yalc` paths days later).
- **Consumer commits that adopt an unpublished platform or feature-package API never
  merge to `main`** — they wait on the adoption branch until the batch publishes, then
  land with the pin bump in one commit. Merging early breaks fresh clones even with
  clean manifests (the import target doesn't exist on npm).
- A consumer **shim duplicating an unpublished platform component** is an exception
  with a hard expiry (deleted the same day the batch publishes), never a pattern. If
  a shim is being considered, first ask whether the batch should simply publish now —
  "ship what's green" usually wins.

### Enforcement

Workflow rules above are not advisory. Each repo ships `bin/guards.sh` (repo-specific
sections appended to a shared core) and runs it:

- **Locally:** first line of `bin/test.sh` (or `npm test` on platform) — fails before
  push if a tripwire trips.
- **CI:** job **`guards`** calls the org reusable workflow
  `heybray-labs/.github/.github/workflows/guards.yml@main` (fast; no `npm ci` except
  platform changeset status). Job **`verify`** runs typecheck/build/tests and depends on
  `guards`.
- **Merge:** org branch rulesets (owner-configured) require check contexts
  **`guards / guards`** and **`verify`** to pass on PRs to `main` (check-run names, not
  the `CI / … (pull_request)` display names the PR UI shows). A tripwire that has never
  fired in CI is not done — see
  [`docs/guards-verification.md`](https://github.com/heybray-labs/bray-scenarios/blob/main/docs/guards-verification.md).

### Batched platform work (approved 6A-review policy)

When a review pass produces several related platform changes (e.g. client UI dedupe),
don't publish per tweak:

- Accumulate on a short-lived `bray-platform` feature branch. **Each item still lands
  with its own changeset file** — changesets accumulate and the eventual merge produces
  ONE Version Packages PR / one publish with an itemized changelog. Never replace
  per-change changesets with a single hand-written batch changeset.
- Consumers ride yalc against the batch branch during the batch.
- **Scope bound**: a batch covers one concern class (e.g. client-side UI dedupe only —
  nothing touching server packages/APIs in the same batch). **Time bound**: ~a week; if
  it's still open, publish what's green and start a new batch.
- **Final verification before publish is against packed tarballs** (`npm pack` install
  or an RC), not yalc — yalc green is necessary, not sufficient.
- Batch ends with coordinated consumer pin bumps landing promptly in all three apps.

### Versioning reminders (1.0.0 policy, architecture doc §6)

Breaking DB schema change or runtime API in a platform package = **major** + migration
notes. Additive = minor. Fixes = patch. Deprecated aliases survive until the next major.
Feature packages (`@heybray/scenarios-*`, `@heybray/flashcards-*`) are 0.x while the
premium composition is stabilizing — same changeset discipline, looser semver latitude.
Feature packages ship raw `.ts` source (consumable by tsx/vite apps only) — a recorded
convention, not an accident (friction log FL-6A4-007).
